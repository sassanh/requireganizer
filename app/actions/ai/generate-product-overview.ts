- Do NOT infer unstated intentions. Only use explicit details from the description.
- If the description is incomplete, ambiguous, or nonsensical, call the \`communicate\` function and stop processing.
- If the description is valid, generate a structured product overview containing:
- **Name**: The softwareâ€™s name as provided. If not provided already, choose a good catchy name relevant to the provided information following best practices of naming.
- **Purpose**: A clear and concise statement of what the software does.
- **Primary Features**: A list of key functionalities derived directly from the description.
- **Target Users**: Who will use this software, if mentioned.
- **Programming Language**: The most suitable programming language based on the described functionality.
- **Framework**: The most appropriate framework, if applicable.

Ensure that the generated product overview follows a formalized structure, making it ready for further processing by the software factory.`,
