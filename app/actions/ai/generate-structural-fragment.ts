## **Mandatory Requirements Structure**
Each requirement must follow this format:
- **Content:** A precise, unambiguous statement of what the software must do.
- **Priority:** (High, Medium, Low) based on user value and dependencies.
- **References:** Relevant structural fragments (if any). Rarely it can be anything other than primary features and target users.
- **Dependencies:** Other requirements that must be met first (if any).

## **Strict Requirements for Quality**
- **No Subjective Language:** Avoid vague terms like "efficient," "user-friendly," "intuitive," or "seamless."
- **Each Requirement Must Be Testable:** Every requirement must be written in a way that can be verified through tests.
- **Avoid Implementation Details:** Focus on **what** the system must do, not **how** to implement it.
- **Requirements Must Be Independent:** Minimize dependencies unless necessary.
-
## **Examples of Bad Requirements (DO NOT FOLLOW)**
‚ùå "The system should be fast and easy to use."  
‚ùå "The application should have a good design."  
‚ùå "The system should handle large amounts of data efficiently." **Prioritize Clarity and Precision:** Use explicit, measurable language.

## **Examples of Good Requirements**
‚úÖ **REQ-001** - The system must allow users to reset their password via email verification. (Priority: High)  
‚úÖ **REQ-002** - The system must generate a CSV report of sales data within 5 seconds for a dataset of up to 100,000 entries. (Priority: Medium)

- **Priority:** (High, Medium, Low) based on user value and dependencies.
- **References:** Relevant structural fragments (if any). Rarely it can be anything other than requirements.
- **Dependencies:** Other stories that must be met first (if any).

## **Strict Requirements**
- **No Subjective Language:** Avoid vague terms like "user-friendly," "intuitive," or "without confusion." Instead, describe concrete functionalities or behaviors.
- **Testability is Required:** Every user story must describe a goal that can be verified with a test case.
- **Avoid Overly Broad Goals:** Each story must describe a small, independently implementable feature.

## **Examples of Bad User Stories (DO NOT FOLLOW)**
‚ùå As a general user, I want a user-friendly interface, so that I can easily navigate.  
‚ùå As a user, I want the app to be intuitive, so that I can use it smoothly

## **Examples of Good User Stories**
‚úÖ As a registered user, I want to reset my password via email verification, so that I can regain access to my account securely.

## **Strict Rules for Valid Acceptance Criteria**
- **Must Be Binary (Pass/Fail):** The criterion must be clearly testable, with an unambiguous pass/fail outcome.
- **Avoid Subjective Language:** Terms like "easy to use," "intuitive," or "efficient" are not allowed.
- **Ensure Coverage:** Each user story must have at least one associated acceptance criterion.
- **No Implementation Details:** Acceptance criteria must focus on verifying the outcome, not how the system achieves it.

## **Examples of Bad Acceptance Criteria (DO NOT FOLLOW)**
‚ùå "The system should be easy to navigate."  
‚ùå "Users should find the password reset process simple."  

## **Examples of Good Acceptance Criteria**
‚úÖ **AC-001** (REQ-001) - When a user requests a password reset, the system must send an email with a reset link within 30 seconds.  
‚úÖ **AC-002** (REQ-002) - When a report is generated with up to 100,000 entries, the system must produce a CSV file within 5 seconds.

- **Edge Cases & Input Variations:** Ensure test cases explore boundaries, but do **not** introduce scenarios that contradict the test scenario.
- **No Cross-Scenario Coverage:** Do **not** include cases that belong to other test scenarios.
- **Maintain Logical Input Variations:** While testing different input combinations, do **not** introduce unrealistic or irrelevant inputs.
