  "description": "Requireganizer is an advanced software application that streamlines iterative software development by leveraging ChatGPT to generate essential documentation and code. The application transforms a user-provided, human-written description of the desired software into a formal description, which serves as the foundation for multiple minor iterations within a major iteration of the development process.\n\nThe major iteration encompasses the generation of user stories, requirements, acceptance criteria, test scenarios, test cases, test code, and functional code. It also includes running retrospectives to address user concerns and updating specifications based on new or revised requirements. Throughout each iteration, ChatGPT cross-references previously generated materials to identify and flag inconsistencies for user review and potential resolution. By automating these crucial steps, Requireganizer streamlines the software development lifecycle, ensuring efficiency and consistency.",
  "productOverview": "Requireganizer is a software application designed to facilitate an iterative software development process by generating necessary documentation and code with the help of ChatGPT. Starting with a human-written description of the desired software, the application guides users through multiple minor iterations to complete a major iteration of the software development process. Each major iteration consists of the following minor iterations:\n\nGenerate a formal description based on the human-written description.\nGenerate user stories based on the formal description.\nGenerate requirements based on the user stories.\nGenerate acceptance criteria based on the requirements.\nGenerate test scenarios and test cases based on acceptance criteria.\nGenerate test code based on test scenarios.\nGenerate code to satisfy tests.\nRun retrospective to understand the concerns of the user in the process.\nAssist the user in updating the specification and initiating the next major iteration based on new/updated requirements.\n\nThroughout each iteration, the generated material from previous minor and major iterations is provided to ChatGPT. If any inconsistencies are identified, ChatGPT should highlight them for user attention and potential correction.",
